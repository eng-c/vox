## Example: Complete HTTP Server

```ec
(Simple HTTP server in EC)

Enable error catching.
Create a TCP socket called "server".
Set option REUSEADDR on server.
Bind server to port 8080.
Listen on server with backlog 10.
Print "Server listening on port 8080...".

Create a buffer called "request".
Create a buffer called "response".

Loop forever,
    accept connection on server into client,
    receive from client into request,
    
    (Build response)
    set response to "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<h1>Hello from EC!</h1>",
    
    send response to client,
    close client.
```

## Example: File Watcher

```ec
(Watch a directory for changes)

Create event monitor called "watcher".
Watch directory "/var/log" for changes in watcher.

Loop forever,
    wait for events into changes,
    for each change in changes,
        print "File changed: " then change's filename.
```

---

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize which syscalls to implement first based on user needs
2. Design consistent EC syntax for each category
3. Implement stdlib assembly routines for each syscall
4. Add parser support for new constructs
5. Add codegen support
6. Write tests and examples
7. Document in LANGUAGE.md
