(Our approximation begins with three)
a float pi is 3.0.

(The denominator starts at two and grows by two each step)
a float denominator is 2.0.

(We alternate between adding and subtracting)
a float direction is 1.0.

(Count our iterations)
a int steps is 0.

(The beautiful dance of convergence)
While steps is less than 500000,
    (Calculate the three consecutive numbers for this term)
    a float called Ist is the denominator,
    a float called IInd is the denominator add 1.0,
    a float called IIIrd is the denominator add 2.0,

    (The denominator is their product)
    a float called product is the Ist multiply the IInd,
    the product is the product multiply the IIIrd,

    (Calculate this term of the series)
    a float term is 4.0 divide product,
    the term is term multiply direction,

    (Add this term to our approximation)
    the pi is pi add term,

    (Flip the direction for the next term)
    the direction is 0.0 subtract direction,

    (Move to the next triple of numbers)
    the denominator is denominator add 2.0,
    increment the steps.
