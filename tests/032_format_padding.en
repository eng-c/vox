(Test format string padding and alignment with expressions)

(Integer padding with expressions)
a number called "small" is 42.
a number called "big" is 1234.
Print "Padded: [{small:6}]".
Print "Zero-pad: [{small:06}]".
Print "Big padded: [{big:8}]".
Print "Sum padded: [{small add big:8}]".
Print "Diff padded: [{big subtract small:8}]".
(Number bases with expressions)
a number called "aa" is 10.
a number called "bb" is 6.
a number called "cc" is 60
Print "Decimal: {aa}".
Print "Hex: {aa:x}".
Print "Binary: {aa:b}".
Print "Octal: {aa:o}".
Print "Sum hex: {aa add bb:x}".
Print "Diff binary: {aa subtract bb:b}".
Print "Product octal: {cc:o}".
Print "Padded hex: [{aa add bb:04x}]".
Print "Padded binary: [{aa add bb:08b}]".
Print "Padded octal: [{aa add bb:04o}]".
