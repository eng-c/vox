(Test nested loops and complex control flow)

(Nested for loops with different ranges)
For each i from 1 to 3,
    For each j from 1 to 2,
        Print "i={i}, j={j}".

(While loop with nested for)
a number called "counter" is 1.
While counter is less than or equal to 2,
    Print "Outer loop: counter={counter}",
    For each k from 1 to 3,
        Print "  Inner: k={k}".
    Increment counter.

(Loop with break and continue)
For each n from 1 to 10,
    If n is equal to 5 then, break.
    If n modulo 2 is equal to 0 then, continue.
    Print "Odd number: {n}".

(Complex conditional with multiple else-if)
a number called "score" is 85.
If score is greater than or equal to 90 then,
    Print "Grade: A".
But if score is greater than or equal to 80 then,
    Print "Grade: B".
But if score is greater than or equal to 70 then,
    Print "Grade: C".
But if score is greater than or equal to 60 then,
    Print "Grade: D".
Otherwise,
    Print "Grade: F".

(Test different scores)
Set score to 95.
If score is greater than or equal to 90 then,
    Print "95: A".
Otherwise, Print "95: Not A".

Set score to 75.
If score is greater than or equal to 90 then,
    Print "75: A".
But if score is greater than or equal to 80 then,
    Print "75: B".
But if score is greater than or equal to 70 then,
    Print "75: C".
Otherwise, Print "75: Not C".
