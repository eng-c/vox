(Test append integration scenarios)

(Test 1: Append in loop)
a list called "loop_result" is [].
a number called "counter" is 1.
While counter is less than or equal to 4,
  append counter to loop_result,
  increment counter.
print "Loop built list:".
For each n in loop_result,
  print the n.

(Test 2: Append in conditional)
a list called "conditional" is [].
a number called "val" is 7.
If val is greater than 5 then,
  append 1 to conditional.
Otherwise,
  append 0 to conditional.
print "Conditional append:".
print element 1 of conditional.

(Test 3: Multiple list appends)
a list called "list1" is [].
a list called "list2" is [].
append 1 to list1.
append 2 to list2.
append 3 to list1.
append 4 to list2.
print "List 1:".
For each n in list1,
  print the n.
print "List 2:".
For each n in list2,
  print the n.
