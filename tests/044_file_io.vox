(Test file I/O and error handling)

(Create test files)
open a file for writing called test1 at "./test_io1.txt".
Write "Hello World" to test1.
Close test1.

open a file for writing called test2 at "./test_io2.txt".
Write "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3" to test2.
Close test2.

(Basic file reading)
open a file for reading called input1 at "./test_io1.txt".
a buffer called "buffer1" is 1024 bytes in size.
Read from input1 into buffer1.
Print "Read from test1: ".
Print buffer1.
Close input1.

(File properties)
open a file for reading called input2 at "./test_io2.txt".
Print "File size: ".
Print input2's size.
Print "File readable: ".
Print input2's readable.
Print "File writable: ".
Print input2's writable.
Close input2.

(Buffer operations with fixed size)
a buffer called "fixed_buf" is 10 bytes in size.
open a file for reading called input3 at "./test_io1.txt".
Read from input3 into fixed_buf.
Print "Fixed buffer size: ".
Print fixed_buf's size.
Print "Fixed buffer capacity: ".
Print fixed_buf's capacity.
Print "Fixed buffer full: ".
Print fixed_buf's full.
Close input3.

(Error handling - file not found)
open a file for reading called missing at "./nonexistent.txt".
a buffer called "error_buf" is 1024 bytes in size.
Read from missing into error_buf.
On error print "File not found error handled".

(Error handling - out of bounds)
a list called "small_list" is [1, 2, 3].
a number called "bad_index" is element 100 of small_list.
On error print "Index out of bounds error handled".

(Byte access and modification)
a buffer called "byte_buf" is "Hello".
Print "Original: ".
Print byte_buf.
Print "First byte: ".
Print byte 1 of byte_buf.
Set byte 1 of byte_buf to 'J'.
Print "Modified: ".
Print byte_buf.

(Appending to files)
a buffer called "append_content" is 1024 bytes in size.
open a file for appending called append_test at "./test_append.txt".
Write "First line" to append_test.
Close append_test.
open a file for appending called append_test at "./test_append.txt".
Write "\nSecond line" to append_test.
Close append_test.
open a file for reading called verify_append at "./test_append.txt".
Read from verify_append into append_content.
Print "Append test result: ".
Print append_content.
Close verify_append.

(Cleanup files)
Delete the file "./test_io1.txt".
Delete the file "./test_io2.txt".
Delete the file "./test_append.txt".
