(Test 1: Basic for-each range)
For each number from 1 to 5, print the number.

(Test 2: Print each loop expansion on range)
print each number from 10 to 12.

(Test 3: Range with variable bounds)
Set start to 1.
Set end to 3.
For each number from start to end, print the number.

(Test 4: Range with but-if conditional branching)
print each number from 1 to 6,
    but if the number modulo 2 is equal to 0 print "even".

(Test 5: Range in function)
To "sum range" with a number called "n".
  A number called "total" is 0.
  For each number from 1 to n, total is total add the number.
