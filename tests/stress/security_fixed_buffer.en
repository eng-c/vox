print "=== FIXED BUFFER OVERFLOW TEST ===".

print "Test 1: Create a tiny fixed buffer (64 bytes)".
a buffer called "tiny" is 64 bytes in size.

print "Test 2: Create a file larger than buffer".
open a file for writing called out at "./overflow_test.txt".
a number called "i" is 0.

While i is less than 100,
    Write "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" to out,
    Write a newline to out,
    Increment i.

Close the out.

print "Test 3: Attempt to read large file into tiny fixed buffer".
open a file for reading called src at "./overflow_test.txt".
Read from src into tiny.

print "Test 4: Check buffer properties".

If tiny's size is equal to tiny's capacity then,
    print "Buffer is full (size equals capacity)".

Close the src.
