(Test type casting and conversions)

(Basic type conversions)
a number called "num" is 42.
a float called "flt" is 3.14159.
a text called "txt" is "123".
a boolean called "_flag" is true.

Print "Number to float: ".
Print num as a float.
Print "Float to number: ".
Print flt as a number.
Print "Number to text: ".
Print num as text.
Print "Text to number: ".
Print txt as a number.
Print "Boolean to number: ".
(Print _flag as a number.)
Print "Number to boolean: ".
Print 0 as a boolean.
Print "Non-zero to boolean: ".
Print num as a boolean.
Print "Boolean to text: ".
(Print _flag as text.)
Print "Text to boolean: ".
Print "true" as a boolean.

(Edge cases with casting)
Print "Float truncation: ".
Print 3.99 as a number.
Print "Negative float: ".
Print -2.7 as a number.
Print "Zero float: ".
Print 0.0 as a number.

(Padded text formatting)
a number called "that hour" is 9.
a number called "that minute" is 5.
Print "Padded hour: ".
Print "{that hour:02}"
Print "Padded minute: ".
Print "{that minute:02}"
