(Proposed syntax test for line-based file reads)

open a file for writing called sample at "./test_read_line.txt".
Write "alpha\nbeta" to sample.
Close sample.

open a file for reading called source at "./test_read_line.txt".
a buffer called "linebuf" is 256 bytes in size.

Read line from source into linebuf.
Print linebuf.

Read line from source into linebuf.
Print linebuf.

Read line from source into linebuf.
If linebuf's empty then,
    Print "<EOF>".

(Reset file pointer and read in a loop)
Seek source to line 1 (Also allow seeking to bytes in the asm modules).

Read line from source into linebuf.
While linebuf is not empty,
    Print linebuf,
    Read line from source into linebuf.

Close source.
Delete the file "./test_read_line.txt".
