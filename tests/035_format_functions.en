(Test format strings with arithmetic expressions)

(Arithmetic expressions in format strings)
a number called "x" is 5.
a number called "y" is 3.
Print "x + y: {x add y}".
Print "x * y: {x multiply y}".
Print "x - y: {x subtract y}".
Print "x / y: {x divide y}".

(Complex arithmetic expressions)
a number called "val_a" is 10.
a number called "val_b" is 20.
a number called "val_c" is 2.
Print "a + b * c: {val_a add val_b multiply val_c}".
Print "(a + b) * c: {val_a add val_b multiply val_c}".
Print "a * b + c: {val_a multiply val_b add val_c}".

(Mixed arithmetic and formatting)
a float called "pi" is 3.14159.
a number called "radius" is 5.
Print "Circle area: {3.14159 multiply radius multiply radius:.2}".
Print "Circle circumference: {2 multiply 3.14159 multiply radius:.2}".

a number called "side" is 4.
Print "Square area: {side multiply side}".
Print "Square perimeter: {4 multiply side}".
Print "Cube volume: {side multiply side multiply side}".
Print "Cube surface area: {6 multiply side multiply side}".
