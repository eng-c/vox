(Test format string expressions - arithmetic operations)

(Basic arithmetic expressions)
a number called "x" is 10.
a number called "y" is 3.
Print "x + y = {x add y}".
Print "x - y = {x subtract y}".
Print "x * y = {x multiply y}".
Print "x / y = {x divide y}".
Print "x % y = {x modulo y}".

(Unary operations)
a number called "verr" is 5.
Print "verr + 0 = {verr add 0}".
Print "0 - verr = {0 subtract verr}".

(Complex expressions)
a number called "base" is 100.
a number called "rate" is 0.15.
Print "total = {base add base multiply rate}".
Print "discounted = {base subtract base multiply rate}".
