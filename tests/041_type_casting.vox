(Test type casting and conversions)

(Float to integer truncation - this works)
Print "Float truncation: ".
Print 3.99 as a number.
Print "Negative float: ".
Print -2.7 as a number.
Print "Zero float: ".
Print 0.0 as a number.

(Boolean conversion)
Print "Zero to boolean: ".
Print 0 as a boolean.
Print "Non-zero to boolean: ".
Print 42 as a boolean.

(Number to float conversion - this is broken)
a number called "qty" is 42.
a float called "qtyF" is the qty as a float.
Print "42 as float: ".
Print the qtyF.

(Padded text formatting)
a number called "that hour" is 9.
a number called "that minute" is 5.
Print "Padded hour: ".
Print "{that hour:02}".
Print "Padded minute: ".
Print "{that minute:02}".
