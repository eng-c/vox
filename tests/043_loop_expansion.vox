(Test loop expansion and advanced features)

(Loop expansion with ranges)
Print "Numbers 1-5:".
print each number from 1 to 5.

Print "Even numbers 2-10:".
print each number from 2 to 10,
    but if the number modulo 2 is equal to 1 print "".

(Loop expansion with lists)
a list called "names" is ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"].
Print "Names:".
print each name from names.

Print "Names with greeting:".
for each person from names,
    print "Hello {person}"

(Conditional print with multiple but-if clauses)
Print "FizzBuzz 1-15:".
print each number from 1 to 15,
    but if the number modulo 15 is equal to 0 print "FizzBuzz",
    but if the number modulo 3 is equal to 0 print "Fizz",
    but if the number modulo 5 is equal to 0 print "Buzz".

(Inline substitution with treating)
a list called "files" is ["data.txt", "-", "output.txt"].
Print "Processing files (treating - as stdin):".
for each filename from files treating "-" as "/dev/stdin",
    print "Processing: {filename}".

(Complex loop expansion with function calls)
To "process" with a text called "item".
    Return a text, "Processed: {item}".

a list called "items" is ["A", "B", "C"].
Print "Function calls in loop expansion:".
for each result from items,
    print "Done: {result}".

(For each loop with but-if)
Print "For each with conditional:".
For each number from 1 to 10,
    Print the number,
        but if the number modulo 3 is equal to 0 print "divisible by 3",
        but if the number is 7 print "lucky seven".
