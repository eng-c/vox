# EC

A compiler that translates English to x86_64 Assembly. By Josjuar Lister 2026

## Overview

`ec` allows you to write programs in natural English sentences, which are then compiled directly to native x86_64 assembly code (with support for more architectures to come).

## Features

- **Natural Language Syntax**: Write code in English sentences
- **Compiles to Assembly**: Direct compilation to x86_64 NASM assembly
- **Modular Standard Library**: Only includes what you use (heap, strings, math, io)
- **Automated Memory Management**: Heap allocations are tracked
- **Zero External Dependencies**: No libc required, uses direct syscalls

## Requirements

- Rust (for building the compiler)
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- ld (GNU linker)

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install nasm rust make

# On Fedora
sudo yum install nasm rust make
```

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Installing

```bash
# Install systemwide
make build
sudo make install

# Uninstall
sudo make uninstall
```

## Usage

```bash
# Compile and run
ec example.en --run

# Compile
ec example.en
```

## Examples

### Hello World
```
Print "Hello, World!".
```

### FizzBuzz-style
```
For each number from 0 to 100, if the number is even print "foo" but if it is odd print "bar".
```

## Architecture

```
Source (.en) → Lexer → Parser → Analyzer → CodeGen → Assembly (.asm)

                           Dependency Tracking
                                    ↓
                        Modular stdlib inclusion
```

## Standard Library Modules

| Module | Included When |
|--------|---------------|
| core.asm | Always |
| io.asm | Using print |
| heap.asm | Using allocate/free |
| string.asm | Using strings |
| math.asm | Using division/modulo/properties |
