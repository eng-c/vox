**EC** is a minimal systems compiler that translates a constrained, sentence-based English syntax directly into native x86_64 assembly — without a **resident runtime system**, virtual machine, or standard library.

The generated binaries consist solely of application code and direct system calls, with no background services, schedulers, garbage collectors, or support libraries.

EC is an experiment in compiler design, language ergonomics, and low-level systems programming, focused on producing predictable, memory-safe, and extremely small executables.

---

## Motivation

EC explores how far a human-readable, deterministic syntax can be lowered *directly* to native assembly while preserving the kinds of guarantees typically associated with modern systems languages.

The project is intentionally minimal:
there is no libc, no garbage collector, and no hidden runtime system. All abstractions are resolved at compile time, and the generated code consists of straightforward NASM assembly and direct system calls.

Rather than hiding system behavior, EC aims to make it explicit — just expressed in a readable form.

---

## Language Model

EC does **not** attempt free-form natural language understanding.

Instead, it uses a constrained, sentence-based grammar designed to remain readable while compiling deterministically. Every construct maps directly to well-defined compiler behavior, with no ambiguity or dynamic interpretation.

The goal is not to “write code like prose”, but to explore an alternative surface syntax that remains precise, analyzable, and predictable at compile time.

For a complete description of the grammar and semantics, see  
**[LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md)**.

---

## Memory Safety Model

Memory safety in EC is achieved without garbage collection, heap tracing, or runtime supervision.  
All safety guarantees are enforced through compile-time structure and **local, inline checks** emitted directly into the generated assembly.

### Pointer Abstraction

User programs never manipulate raw pointers directly.  
Instead, memory is accessed through compiler-managed buffers, which encapsulate allocation, size tracking, and lifetime.

### Dynamic and Fixed Buffers

- Buffers grow dynamically as needed, with their size tracked explicitly.
- Fixed-size buffers can be declared and resized in a controlled manner.
- All buffer operations are lowered to predictable, explicit assembly.

### Bounds-Checked Access

Programs may read or write any byte within a buffer.

If an access attempts to exceed the buffer’s bounds:
- The operation becomes a **no-op**
- An **error flag** is set
- Execution continues, allowing the program to explicitly detect and handle the error

These checks are emitted inline at the access site and do not rely on traps, exceptions, or runtime handlers.

### Resource Tracking and Cleanup

Buffers, file descriptors, and other system resources are tracked by the compiler.

All tracked resources are:
- Explicitly released when possible
- Automatically freed or closed on program exit, even if cleanup is omitted

This cleanup is deterministic and non-allocating, and does not involve object tracing or liveness analysis. It is equivalent to explicit teardown code written manually in low-level systems programs.

While EC does not replicate Rust’s type system, it aims for a similar *practical outcome*: predictable, memory-safe programs without a garbage collector or runtime system.

---

## Minimal Executables

Because EC compiles directly to simple assembly and avoids a runtime system or standard library, the resulting executables are extremely small.

This makes EC well-suited for static utilities, constrained environments, and systems-level tooling where predictability and size matter more than abstraction depth.

## Features

* Direct compilation to native x86_64 NASM assembly
* No resident runtime system or libc; uses direct system calls
* Deterministic sentence-based syntax
* Compile-time memory and resource tracking
* Modular library of core macros with dependency inclusion
* Extremely small statically linked executables

## Example Program

Below is a complete EC program reimplementing the Unix `cat` utility.

This example demonstrates:
- File I/O
- Argument handling
- Buffer reuse
- Loop expansion over arguments
- Automatic resource cleanup

```text
Open a file for writing called "output" at "/dev/stdout".
Create a buffer called "content".

If arguments's empty then,
    open a file for reading called "source" at "/dev/stdin",
    read from source into content,
    write content to output,
    close source,
    exit 0.

Open a file called "source" for reading at each filename from arguments's all treating "-" as "/dev/stdin",
    read from source into content,
    write content to output,
    close source.
````

The loop expansion construct:

```
open ... at each X from Y
```

is resolved entirely at compile time and expands into explicit control flow with no runtime interpretation.

This program compiles to native assembly and produces a working executable without libc, dynamic linking, or a runtime system.

## Architecture

```
Source (.en)
   ↓
Lexer → Parser → Analyzer → CodeGen → Assembly (.asm)
                         ↓
                Dependency Tracking
                         ↓
             Modular coreasm inclusion
```

Each stage operates on explicit intermediate representations.
No dynamic analysis or runtime interpretation occurs after compilation.

## Roadmap

EC is under active development. Planned work includes:

1. **Shared Libraries**
   Versioned shared libraries with explicit naming, symbol scoping, and backward compatibility guarantees.

2. **User-Defined Types**
   Structs and custom types with compile-time layout and predictable memory semantics.

3. **Networking Abstractions**
   High-level interfaces built on top of system calls, provided via libraries (e.g. HTTP/1.0 reference implementation).

4. **Additional Architectures**
   Planned targets include Win64, AArch64, ARM64, MIPS, and RISC-V.

5. **Expanded System Interfaces**
   Higher-level abstractions for multithreading, file descriptor polling, filesystem operations, and system control.

6. **Math and Numeric Optimization**
   Continued optimization of numeric code generation, with a goal of matching or exceeding C performance in benchmarks.

---

## Non-Goals

* Free-form natural language interpretation
* JIT compilation or runtime reflection
* Dynamic typing or implicit control flow
* Hiding system behavior behind opaque abstractions
* Language-level runtime systems or background memory management

---

## Status

EC is experimental but functional.
Core language features are implemented and exercised by real programs, with additional capabilities under active development.
